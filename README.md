## Hi there 👋

I'm a Hardware Design Engineer, with a passion for coding.

I enjoy working on all sorts of tools and scripts, either to make my life easier, satisfy my curiosities, or as a creative outlet.

First learned C/C++, but nowdays Python is my go-to if I want to create something. I started using GitHub to document my progress, and to share my ideas and what I'm working on.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kivy, openGL and Python
- 🔭 I’m currently working on organizing my projects, so I can share them with You.
